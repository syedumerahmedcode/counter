## Introduction

The project is called counter and via this project, the user can increase or decrease the counter when the user click a button. This program can be used to keep track of repeatable task which increases or decreases over time. Additionally, the user can also reset the counter when needed.

The application is coded in Visual Studio Code and deployed using Live server extension. This project is the first one in a series of basic javascript project created for better understanding of the technology and how things work. The inspiration for this project is coming from this [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-tutorial-for-beginners-w/) course.

## Out Of Scope

Since this is an beginner project in which the focus is just to learn the some basic javascript, testing is out of scope of this project. Similarly, continous delivery(either via Docker or github Pilot) is out of scope of this project.

## Project structure

The project consists of 3 main files which are described below:

- index.html
- app.js
- styles.css

Additionally, a _setup_ folder is also created which contains the initial project in its basic form and it was used as basis for the finished project.

## index.html

## Technologies Used

- [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/): JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions(A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable). While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based(Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which classes are not explicitly defined, but rather derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class or, less frequently, adding them to an empty object. In simple words: this type of style allows the creation of an object without first defining its class.), multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
- [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp): HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript). HTML5 is the latest version of HTML.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download): Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer): Launch a development local Server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages
